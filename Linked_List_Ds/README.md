# Linked List 
+ When we want to work with unknown number of data values, we use a linked list data structure to organize the data.
+ Linked list is a linear data structure that contains sequence of elements such that each elements links to its next element in the sequence.
+ Each element in a linked list is called as **"Node"**


# Single Linked list 
+ Single linked list is a sequence of elements in which every elements has link to its next element in the sequence.
+ In any single linked list, the individual element is called as **"Node"**.
+ Every "Node" contains two fields, **data** and **next**.
+ The **data** field is used to store actual value of the node. 
+ The **next** field is used to store the address of the next node in the sequence.
