# Data Structure using C language

# Data Structure
* A *data structure* is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively.

## Linear DS                 
* Array                   
* Linked list
* Stack
* Queue

## Defination:
### Array:
+ An Array is a variable which can store multiple values of same data type at a time. __(or)__
+ It is a collection of similar data items stored in continous memory locations with single name.

```
Syntax: datatype arrayName[size];
```

### Linked List:
+ Linked list is a linear data structure that contains sequence of elements such that each element link to it's next element in the sequence.
+ Each element in the linked list is called __"Node"__.

### Stack
+ Stack is a linear data structure in which the insertion and deletion operations are performed at only one end.
+ In a stack, adding and removing of elements are performed at single position which is known as __"top"__. 
+ That means, new element is added at top of the stack and an element is removed from the top of the stack.
+ In stack, the insertion and deletion operations are performed based on __LIFO (Last In First Out) principle.__
