# Stack
+ Stack is a linear data structure in which the insertion and deletion operations are performed at only one end. 
+ In a stack, adding and removing of elements are performed at single position which is known as "top".
+ That means, new element is added at top of the stack and an element is removed from the top of the stack.
+ In stack, the insertion and deletion operations are performed based on __LIFO (Last In First Out) principle.__

+ In a stack, the __insertion__ operation is performed using a function called __"push"__. 
+ In a stack, the __deletion__ operation is performed using a function called __"pop"__.

### Example:

If we want to create a stack by inserting 10,45,12,16,35 and 50. Then 10 becomes the bottom
most element and 50 is the top most element. Top is at 50 as shown in the image below...
