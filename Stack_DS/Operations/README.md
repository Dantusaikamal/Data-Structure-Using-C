# Operations on Stack

The following operations are performed on the stack...
1. __Push__ (To insert an element on to the stack)
2. __Pop__ (To delete an element from the stack)
3. __Display__ (To display elements of the stack)

Stack data structure can be implement in two ways. They are as follows...
1. Using Array
2. Using Linked List

### Use of implementing array and linked list
+ When stack is implemented **using array**, that stack can organize only __limited number of elements__. 
+ When stack is implemented **using linked list**, that stack can organize __unlimited number of elements__.
